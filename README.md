# Python Sales EDA – Sujata Dadge

## 💡 Project Overview  
This project explores a real-world sales dataset and demonstrates how I applied Python for exploratory data analysis (EDA). It covers data cleaning, transformation, visualisation and deriving actionable business insights.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries  
- Python (version 3.x)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Optional: other libraries as required

## 📊 Workflow  
1. Load and inspect the dataset  
2. Clean & preprocess data (handle missing values, format dates, etc.)  
3. Perform exploratory analysis:  
   - Summary statistics  
   - Time-series trends  
   - Product / region / sales category breakdowns  
4. Create visualisations to highlight key patterns  
5. Derive business insights and suggest recommendations  

## 🎯 Key Learnings  
- Gained hands-on experience with data wrangling in Python  
- Learned how to interpret sales trends and product/region performance  
- Improved ability to communicate insights via data visualisations  
- Built a portfolio-ready project that reflects analytical mindset  

## 📁 How to Use  
1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SujataDadge/python-sales-eda-sujata.git
